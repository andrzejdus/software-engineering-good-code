## code = API

## why
* 75% reading (understanding code)
https://blog.codinghorror.com/when-understanding-means-rewriting/
* it's cool

## consistency
* naming
  * increase/decrease
  * add/delete
  * insert/remove
* code style

Examples
* git
  * `git fetch` + `git merge` = `git pull` vs `git checkout` + `git branch` = `git checkout -b`
  * `git commit` ignores local, unstaged changes in foo.txt; `git commit foo.txt` doesn’t


## orthogonality

## discoverability

## adaptation

## information hiding: : physical and logical

## loose coupling

## model the problem domain

## be minimally complete

## beware of extra generality

## class should define what to do not how its done

## favor object composition over class inheritance

## Heisenbugs
